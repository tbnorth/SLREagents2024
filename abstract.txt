Who messed up my lake?

Initial results from a lake-wide agent based simulation releasing virtual
drifters from multiple tributaries over time. We examine the use of
agent based modeling to break down the sources contributing to the
composition of nearshore waters. Knowing that flow is highly biased in
favor of long shore flow over offshore flow, we investigate possible
origins of the water (and implicitly nutrients) in the nearshore around
the lake. Considerations include 2D vs. 3D transport, the role of
diffusion, and computational challenges (days × tributaries generate
large numbers of agents), and visualization and interpretation of
results.
